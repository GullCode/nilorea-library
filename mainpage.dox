\section aboutlib About Nilorea Library

This library should bring you (and if it is already coded) some usefull C tools
(Typedefs, structs, linked lists, network engine, 2dIso engine and more)

DO NOT take care of the name, i was having no ideas so i decide to give a simply name.

For better using of the library, some documentations&examples will be written, but there is still 
nothing written ;)


\section require Requirements


 Allegro   5.0.0 or better http://alleg.sf.net/

 The socket libs (winsock or socket)

 Pthread lib (posix pthread for windows or linux)

\section install Installation
Just type make and use the library or put the right files in your LIB and INCLUDE directory, link them with your code and let's go ! \n
Don't forget to define FLAGS for parts you don't need, it can save you memory and compilation time.


\section FLAGS FLAGS when using Nilorea

Define platform if needed:

LINUX | WIN

You should use one of the folowing if you don't need it: 

 NOALLEGRO |  NOPTHREAD | NONETWORK | NOSTR | NOISOENGINE | NOSOUND

\section WARNINGS Be carefull

Sometimes when i talk about a function i use the 'low-level' words to aim your attention.\n
It's because we talk about functions who returns nothing and who won't test if they are\n
going to write inside or outside the memory. It's your responsability to use them correctly.\n

\section end Closing Words

Nilorea is a 'make life easier' library, you're welcome using it.\n
Everything inside is free or under GPL license, read it at http://www.gnu.org/license/gpl.html\n

Have nice brain storm, and don't forget to submit me bugs !
